# Test-driving the R & Oracle bookdown book

If you're like normal people, you love R and hate Oracle. That's OK. I'm not telling you to go buy an Oracle database. What I am telling you though, is that if you happen to have one, there is a lot you can do with it. Especially if it is rigged for analytical workloads.

This book assumes you know *some* basic SQL, but introduces a lot of analytical functions that work well as a complement to R. There is a lot of functional overlap, so make sure to use SQL where SQL makes sense to you, and R where R makes sense. If you are comfortable with R and not SQL, your main use case is perhaps to shift the initial, heavy filtering and aggregations from R (which might be running on your laptop) to the database (which is probably running on a very beefy server).

This book is written with Oracle in mind, but much of it is relevant for other databases as well. With some adaptations.
